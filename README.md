## Exploring the Applications of Wavelet Transforms in Image and Signal Processing
The Wavelet Research Project is an exploration into the power of wavelet transforms for image processing. This project covers key topics such as wavelet compression, denoising, and feature extraction, and provides a comparison with other popular techniques such as the Fourier Transform and the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).

### Contents
* Wavelet Compression: This section explains how wavelet transforms can be used for image compression, and compares the results with those obtained using Fourier Transform and DCT.
* Wavelet Denoising: This section demonstrates the use of wavelet-based techniques for denoising images, and compares the quality of denoising with Fourier Transform and DCT methods.
* Wavelet Feature Extraction: In this section, we explore how wavelet transforms can be used for feature extraction in images, and how this compares with the use of Fourier Transform and DCT.

### Getting Started
To get started with the project, you'll need to have Python installed on your system, along with the following libraries: numpy, matplotlib, skimage, scipy, pywt. If you are running a Jupyter notebook, these packages can be installed via pip:

```
pip install numpy matplotlib skimage scipy pywt
```

Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/violeta-kastreva/wavelet-research.git
cd wavelet-research
```
You can then open the Jupyter notebook to view and run the project:

```
jupyter notebook
```
